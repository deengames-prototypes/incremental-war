# Parents/Educator's Guide

I will eventually replace this with a real, rich-text version.

# Game Summary

TODO: fill this out better. It's an incremental/idle game mixed with an RTS, set in a distant future, themed around GMO experimentaion and system thinking.

# Main Educational Value
Our primary educational goal is to teach players about "systems thinking," which is a modern, 21st-century skill. Systems Thinking usually means "thinking about the relationships between components/systems, instead of how individual parts operate."

To actualize this in our game, the player must build "tiers" of different actions, each building upon the tier below it (like a multi-layered cake):

- **Resources:** As the base, you first mine these manually and soon build buildings to auto-mine them. The earliest stages of the game revolve around managing resource-mining.
- **Energy and Buildings:** Soon after getting a handle on resources, players can build different buildings. NEGs (Neodymium Energy Generators) generate a set amount of energy per second, which different units and buildings consume. This stage of the game reolves around managing the energy generation and consumption rate.
- **Units:** The third stage of the game revolves around building units. Building units consumes a specific amount of energy *and resources* per second (eg. an infantry unit may consume one polymetal alloy per second + one neodymium per second + one energy per second) to produce.

Thus, the user is slowly introduced to additional layers and things to manage, which build upon the things they managed before; and the system is always in flux, where a small change to any part (eg. a new resource harvester) may ripple throughout the system (eg. insufficient energy for building units).

This is very similar to software development, where complex inter-system communication governs how functionality works, and small component-level changes can ripple (sometimes destructively) and cause dysfunction in other parts of the system.

# Secondary Educational Value
Based on the setting and plot of the game, we can impart secondary educational values into the player:

- **The dangers of genetic modification:** The main backstory of the game, and indeed the final stage of the game, revolves around defeating genetically-modified creatures, bred for war, who escape and wreak havoc upon the world.
- **Experimentation:** The game consists of three bosses, each with a unique ability that must be puzzled out (eg. a tough, regenerative hide that requires explosives to destroy). The player must experiment and discover how to defeat them.
- **Discovery:** Incremental games as a medium naturally lead to experimentation. The player often is not directly given a goal, and instead, has to tinker and build and discover what unlocks the next part of the game.
- **Near-Future Technology:** The core resources (polymetal alloy and neodymium), and buildings (miner/harvester), are based on real-world uses and extractions of these resources today. Players directly consume these resources throughout the game, and may be piqued to investigate further about these technologies.

# Incremental War
A mixture of an incremental game and an RTS.  Design goals:

- Create an incremental game
- Active vs. Inactive: more on inactive side
- Session gameplay: 3x 5-10 minute sessions per day max (usually)
- Learn how to use IAP on Android
- Endless, for stickiness
- Multiple strategies, eg. unit builds
